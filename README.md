# Future
I don't like PHP. I'm now rewriting this system with node.js and I will keep this version in this repository. The first beta will release on about Jun, 2016 to March, 2016.
Rewriting this system with node.js can improve the performance a lot. This version will continue to fix bugs.
You can fork this project and create a new pull request to make this php version better.
